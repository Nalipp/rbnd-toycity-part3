How long did you spend working on this project?
  More than 8 hours. :p

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  Getting the different classes to work with each other. And finding ways to make the code more direct.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
  1. Added sales total to the transaction class, to be able to calculate the price plus sales tax.
  2. Added delete function to transaction class, to be able to reverse transactions once they are created.

Where do you still have room to grow?
  I think I am too slow. It takes a while to figure out whats going on even in the code I wrote.
  I think it would be helpful to have a database of well written code to read and play around with.
  Also need to get a better grasp of when to place methods in private.


**Note
Apology for the last submission with 4 required fixes.
I somehow submitted an older version of the code through github. :\
